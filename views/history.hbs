<p style="text-font:copperplate"> Del’s Barbershop is a slice of down-home Americana. This four chair barbershop has been a fixture on South Escondido Boulevard for over 50 years. Del’s is a place where regular guys hang out, joke around, dish the local gossip and poke fun at everyone from the president to the man sitting one chair over. You get a great haircut as well! </p>

<p>Del Engelbrecht opened the barbershop on South Escondido Boulevard in October 1959 when the flat-top crew cut was all the craze. Del retired in 1981 and has since handed down the family business to his son Dan Engelbrecht who began his career at the barbershop in 1973. Del’s 32 year old grandson Jason started cutting hair in January 1999, carrying on the family tradition.</p>
<p>The tiny barbershop is a throwback to the 1960’s and there is just enough room for four chrome and vinyl barber chairs, a small waiting area and a barbershop pole swirling with red, white and blue. The shop specializes in flattops along with current trends. But customers don’t go there for just for the haircuts, it’s a great place to meet all your friends and catch up on all the latest ‘gossip’. The shop’s four full time barbers (Dan Engelbrecht, Al Strachan, Jason Engelbrecht and Josh Paoli) boast that when it comes to Escondido, they know just about everything that’s going on.</p>
<p>Good times abound at Del’s Barbershop year round. As Dan says "You never know what friends might be waiting here for you…we can’t wait to get to work in the morning.</p>
